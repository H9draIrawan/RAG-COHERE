        "without reason is mere fancy, but reason without imagination is sterile. That is partly why scientists and philosophers alike have always used imaginary scenarios to help sharpen their ideas and push them to their limits. The purpose of such \u2018thought experiments\u2019 is to strip away the things that complicate matters in real life in order to focus clearly on the essence of a problem. So, for example, a real -life ethical dilemma will always be complicated by contingent, context-specific factors. Take the general issue of whether eating meat is morally wrong. If you consider whether it is wrong to eat the meat you have an opportunity to consume, multiple factors come into play. Some animals will have been factory farmed, some humanely reared, some caught wild. Some animals will have been raised on land that was once rainforest, others will have freely grazed on open pastures.

        "ave been raised on land that was once rainforest, others will have freely grazed on open pastures. Some meat will be organic, some will be genetically modified, some will have been shipped from the other side of the world. Deciding the ethical rights and wrongs requires untangling all these multiple factors, and weighing up the different considerations accordingly. Thought experiments can help because, like scientific experiments, they aim to isolate the key variables, the specific factors under examination, to see what difference they, and they alone, make to our understanding of the world. So if we want to consider the ethics of eating animals we can imagine situations in which the particular issue of concern is the only one to differ betwee n two scenarios. If we\u2019re worried about how we treat farm animals, let us imagine what difference good treatment, and good treatment alone, makes.

If our intentions are under scrutiny, we can ask what difference does it make if the chicken in your kiev died in an accident whereas mine had its neck wrung intentionally, but before that they had lived identical lives. We can simply stipulate that all other things are equal, so the only question we need to settle is the core moral one. Thought experiments do not just have the advantage of being tidier than real life. They can actually help us think about things that we could, or would, not test in real life. Sometimes they require us to imagine what is impractical or even impossible, either for us right now or f or all people at all times. Although what these experiments ask us to consider can seem outlandish, the purpose is the same as for any thought experiment: to keep our focus on one core concept or problem.

If an impossible scenario helps us to do that, then its impossibility need not concern us. The experiment is merely a tool to aid our thinking, it does not pretend to describe actual life. The 100 scenarios in this book are inspired mostly, but not always, by the arguments of philosophers. Sometimes the y take assumptions we rarely question and turn them upside down. Sometimes they suggest ways of resolving what seem to be intractable problems. And sometimes they make us see problems which don\u2019t seem like problems at all until you follow through their imp lications. This is neither a reference book nor a collection of answers to old puzzles; it is rather a provocation, a stimulus to further thought.

In the comments that follow the scenarios, I may suggest a way out of the difficulty or I may be playing devil\u2019s advocate: it is for you to decide which. Similarly, the cross -referencing is intended to be suggestive, not scientific. Sometimes the connections between the scenarios will be obvious. On other occasions the link is itself a means of making you look at the problem in a new light. Many lines of thought can be started from this book. But none ends in it.**A note on sources** Where there are one or more identifiable sources for an experiment, I have included details of them at the end of the scenario .

Where no source is given, it is usually because the thought experiment is inspired by a wider debate in which no one or two sources can be singled out. It should not be taken necessarily to indicate originality on my part. Some of these scenarios may have sources of which I am unaware and have therefore not credited. I would be happy to rectify any such omissions in any future editions. **1. The evil demon** Is anything so self-evident that it cannot be doubted? Is it not poss ible that our lives are no more than dreams, or that the world is just a figment of our imaginations?

        "these notions are, the mere fact that they are conceivable shows that the reality of the physical world can be doubted. There are other ideas, however, which seem to be so clear and self-evident that they must be true. For instance, whether you are awake or asleep, two plus two makes four. A triangle must have three sides whether the world, real or imaginary, contains triangles or not. But what if God, or some powerful, malicious demon, is tricking you? Couldn\u2019t such an evil spirit fool you into believing that the false is obviously true? Haven\u2019t we seen hypnotists make people count to ten, unaware that they have missed out the number seven? And what of a man who, in a dream, hears four strikes of the clock tower bell and finds himself thinking, \u2018How odd.

Source: The first medit ation from Meditations by Ren\u00e9 Descartes (1641) Philosophers have a habit of finding something we think we all know and then providing reasons for making us doubt we know it after all. Laws of nature, the physical world, God, goodness, other minds, justice, time \u2013 philosophers have found reasons to doubt them all. In order to advance such profoundly sceptical arguments, the philosopher needs to use the one thing he cannot afford to doubt: his own capacity to think rationally. So, for example, the reality of time can be doubted because the traditional concept of time contains contradictions. These contradictions involve a violation of basic logical principles, such as the impossibility of both being and not being at the same time. It is the ability to reco gnise that these are logical contradictions that allows the philosopher to reason and justify",

It is the ability to reco gnise that these are logical contradictions that allows the philosopher to reason and justify his doubt. But if we were under the influence of a powerful deceiving demon, a possibility first proposed by the seventeenth-century French philosopher Ren\u00e9 Desc artes, then we might be wrong to take these basic logical principles to be true. It may seem to us that they are obvious and self -evident, but to the person under hypnosis it may seem obvious and self -evident that eight follows six. To the deluded dreamer it may seem obvious and self-evident that the clock has struck one selfaggrandising four times, when we all \u2018know\u2019 it has actually struck four o\u2019clock once.

We could just be mad, and our insanity may blind us to the fact that others do not view the world the way we do. Or perhaps evolution has endowed all of our minds with a fundamentally flawed set of logical principles. Maybe we are better ada pted to survival if we take certain falsehoods to be \u2018obviously true\u2019. The demon may be encoded in our DNA. The genius of this thought experiment is that, in order to judge its plausibility, we have to rely on the one thing the test is supposed to call into doubt: our capacity to reason well. We have to judge whether we are able to think well by thinking as well as we can. So we cannot set ourselves apart from the faculty of thought we are supposed to be assessing to judge it from a neutral perspective. It is like trying to use a suspect set of scales to weigh itself, in order to test its accuracy. Perhaps this is the thought",

Perhaps this is the thought experiment\u2019s pay -off: our capacity to reason has to be taken as basic for any serious thought to be undertaken at all. We can doubt wh ether any particular piece of reasoning is sound by thinking hard about it. But we cannot doubt whether our general capacity for reason is flawed or not. At best we can say it seems to serve us well enough. Is that enough to vindicate rationality, or does it leave it weakened? See also 19. Bursting the soap bubble 28. Nightmare scenario 51.

However, now he is facing a lawsuit fro m a disgruntled customer who is claiming the company actually killed him. His argument is simple: the teletransporter works by scanning your brain and body cell by cell, destroying them, beaming the information to Mars and reconstructing you there. Althoug h the person on Mars looks, feels and thinks just like a person who has been sent to sleep and zapped across space, the claimant argues that what actually happens is that you are murdered and replaced by a clone.

The day no one wakes up thinking he is me, with my memories, plans and personalities, is the day I have died. The \u2018psychological continuity\u2019 theory of personal identity has an intuitive appeal. It is only because it seems to reflect our fundamental intuitions that we can make sense of stories such as Kafka\u2019s Metamorphosis, in which a man wakes up in the body of a beetle. We instantly recognise that the man is the beetle because his mind inhabits it. Mental, not physical continuity, marks him out as the same person. But in the case of teletransportation, although we do have psychological continuity as complete as it is in ordinary life, it also seems beyond doubt tha t what has been created is a copy, a clone.

It is the same only in the sense that two statues cast from the same mould are the same: they are identical in every detail but they are distinct entities nonetheless. If you chip one, the other remains undamaged. It is not as though Stelios doesn\u2019t know how his teletransporter works. He just doesn\u2019t see why the fact that, strictly speaking, the machine \u2018clones\u2019 him every time should matter. What matters to him is that, as far as he is concerned, he walks into the booth and wakes up on another planet. The physical mechanism is irrelevant. If that sounds glib, consider for a moment the possibility that one night, a few years ago, you were kidnapped i n your sleep, processed by the teletransporter, and the resulting person returned, unknowing, to your bed.

Had this happened, you would have no way of telling, because your conscious experience of your ongoing life as a continuing being would be exactly th e same if it had not happened. The fact of teletransportation, in some sense, leaves your life and world exactly as it was. Perhaps then to ask whether Stelios is a clone or \u2018the same\u2019 person is the wrong question. Perhaps we should instead ask what matter s about our past and future existence. And maybe the answer to that is psychological continuity, by whatever means necessary. See also 38. I am a brain 46.

She looked up to discover that her cousin, Mahavir, had returned from a trip he had begun two years before. He looked in good health, and over dinner he told them of his adventures. There were tales of robbers, wild animals, great mountains and other incredible sights and adventures. But what really stunned Dhara was his claim to have seen something called \u2018 ice\u2019. \u2018I went to regions where it was so cold, the water stopped flowing and formed a solid, translucent block,\u2019 said Mahavir. \u2018What is more amazing is that there is no state in between where the liquid thickens.

Source: Chapter X \u2018On Miracles\u2019 from An Essay Concerning Human Understanding by David Hume (1748) How could Dhara be right when in one sense she was so obviously wro ng? We know that Mahavir\u2019s account of ice was not a fantasy on a par with tales of dragons, but an accurate description of what happens to water at freezing point. Dhara was right in the sense that sometimes we are wrong for the right reasons. Take, for ex ample, get-rich-quick schemes.

However, that means it is possible that one day you will ignore a genuine opportunity and forgo great wealth. That particular email would not be a fraud, yet in an important sense you would still have reasoned correctly when you concluded it probably was. The same general point applies to Dhara. We should not believe everything we are told about how the natural world works.

The problem is, however, that sometimes something genuinely does come along that forces us t o reconsider what we thought we knew. We cannot dismiss an idea simply because it doesn\u2019t fit with our present beliefs. Rather, we need very good reasons to do so, because what is firm and established has to carry more weight than what is being claimed by an individual or small group which goes against it.

You simply accept that your wife satisfies some of your needs and your mistress others.

If we would have no objection to the cyber sex, that would suggest that the crucia l factor is the involvement of another person. Our most intimate relationship must be one-to-one and exclusive.

On this view, when Dick turns on a computer to turn him on, he is signalling that he has stopped s eeing his wife as the person with whom he wishes to express his sexuality. An affair is usually a symptom of a relationship\u2019s existing problems, not the first cause of them. This fits this diagnosis of the source of the unease with Dick\u2019s virtual lover. For it is of course true, even before he has logged on to his stimulating simulation for the first time, that he has already stopped seeing his wife sexually in the way he once did.

Here the problem is the alleged misery of an animal while it is alive, rather than the fact of its death. Second is the act of killing itself, which brings to an end the li fe of a creature which would otherwise have a decent future. The first issue can be dealt with simply by making sure the animal is kept in good conditions. Many people who are concerned for animal welfare will nonetheless eat meats such as free-range poultry and lamb, which cannot be intensively reared. However, this still leaves the second rationale for vegetarianism: objection to the act of killing.

On Marge\u2019s logic, however, the odds are fixed at round one. And so, in the final, although there are only two people left, Marge would reason that each one has only a 1 in 64 chance of winning. Which would mean, of course, that that there is only a 1 in 32 chance of either person winning!

The point is that the improbability of what has happened in the past does not affect the probability of what is yet to happen. Marge should have seen this.

In such circumstances, we should pursue the least bad option. That allows us to say t hat Sacks both does the best he can and does wrong. But this solution merely creates a different problem.

But does it reflect the complexity of the world or is it a sophistical contortion to justify the unjustifiable? The alternative is to say that the end does not justify the means. Sacks should refuse.

Quantum theory has shown that to be false since not all causal processes are strictly determined by prior conditions. There is more indeterminacy in the universe than Laplace supposed. Nevertheless, quantum effec ts occur only at the smallest level, and most objects in the world do work as though they were strictly determined by prior causes, just as Laplace thought.

We would see people behave time and time again exactly as predicted by a computer that had knowledge only of the physical states of their brains and environments. Contestants would be making decisions that the computer calculated they were bound to make. In short, they would appear not to be free agents making autonomous choices, but automata. How should we respond to this prospect? One way is to deny its possibility. Human beings do have free will, and that means no computer could ever do what we imagine Pierre doing.

Even if it is true that quantum theory introduces more unpredictability than our thought experiment has allowed, all it would do is replace an entirely predictable causal process with one which contains unpredictable, random elements. But our actions are no more free if they are the result of random causal processes than if they are the result of strictly determined ones. Free will appears to require that we escape the physical causal chain altogether. And that, it seems, we cannot do.

For they are making their decisions about the right way to distribute goods behind a \u2018veil of ignorance\u2019 that leaves them in the dark as to how easily they will cope with life on the colony.

That would lead them to treat those with different skills the same, which seems t o be very fair indeed. Rawls thought that if we want to know what fairness is on Earth, we should imagine ourselves to be in a similar position. The key difference is that we should also imagine that we do not know whether we will be smart or stupid, dextr ous or clumsy, fit or sickly. That way we will be able to come up with rules to determine how to distribute goods which are completely fair and do not discriminate against anyone. Rawls thought that if we undertook this process rationally, we would end up with a system in which we always make sure the worst off are as well off as possible. This is because we would not know if we would ourselves be on society\u2019s scrapheap. Therefore we would prudently make sure that, i",

All this leads to a traditional form of liberal social democracy, in which some variations in fortune are allowed, just as long as it is not to the cost of the least fortunate.

But that would at best preserve a record of the work, not the picture itself. And if he did try this, by the time he got back, the image would probably have been erased by the ocean.

Source: \u2018In a Season of Calm Weather\u2019 by Ray Bradbury, reprinted in A Medicine for Melancholy (Avon Books, 1981) There is no general principle which states that there is something tragic about a work of art which doesn\u2019t persist over time. It depends entirely on what form the art takes. It is just absurd to think that a performance should have a perma nent existence in the same way that a sculpture does. Of course, we can film a performance, or preserve its script. But neither of these methods freezes the work itself in time, as anyone who has seen a memorable play or concert and then watched it on film knows. When it comes to sculpture and painting, preservation is seen as the ideal. But how sharp is the distinction between the performance and plastic arts?

Recognising that there is no sharp dividing line between the performative and the plastic may prompt us to reconsider our attitudes towards preservation and restoration. In ge neral, we assume that it is desirable to keep, or restore, pictures so that they are as similar to how they were when they were new. But perhaps we should see the slow deterioration of artworks as an essential part of their performative dimension. It is certainly the case that many artists take into account how their works will age when they create them.

Perhaps we could go further and say that our desire to preserve is a form of denial about our own mortality. The fact that art can endure longer than people has led som e to seek a form of proxy immortality through it. (Although Woody Allen famously claimed he did not want immortality through art, but through not dying.) If we accept that art is mortal too, and that nothing is truly permanent, maybe we can see more clearl y where the value of art and life is to be found: in experiencing them. See also 37.

This is what the story of Mary illustrates. As a scientist, Mary knows everything about red in physical terms. Yet there is something she doesn\u2019t know: what it looks like. No scientific account of the world can give her this knowledge.

Is this a case of jumping out of the dualist frying pan into the physicalist fire? Let us imagine that Mary is herself a physicalist. What might she say? Perhaps she would start by pointing out that there is a difference between appearances and reality: there is a way things are and a way they appear to be. Science concerns itself with the former, not the latter, because knowledge is always of how things are, not as they merely seem to be.

Indeed, we make quite fine discriminations in such cases.

In a strange way, then, our willingness to take the money is fuelled in par t by a peculiar sense of justice. But even if we do conclude that this is a form of justifiable theft, it is theft nonetheless. The fact that it is the result of an accident, with no intention to steal, is irrelevant.

So, for example, morality obliges you to pluck a drowning child out of a pond when it is not difficult to do so, but to leap into a stormy sea, risking your own life, to save someone is to do more than morality requires. To put it another way, someone will be praised for doing a supererogatory act, but won\u2019t be blamed for not doing it.

So, Achilles once more needs to get to where Tarquin is now, in order to overtake him, in which time, Tarquin would have moved forward. And so on. You get the picture. It\u2019s just logically and mathematically impossible for Achilles to overtake the beast.

The argument seems to demonstrate that Achilles can\u2019t overtake the tortoise, but experience tells us that of course he can. But there seems to be nothing wrong either with the argument or with what experience tells us. Some have thought they can identify a flaw in the argument. It works only if you assume that time and space are continuous wholes which can be divided up into ever smaller chunks ad infinitum. This is because the argument depends on the idea that there is always a length of space, however small, over which the tortoise will have moved on a little distance, however short, in the period of time, however br ief, it takes Achilles to get to where the tortoise was.

This was, of course, strictly prohibited. But Kenneth managed to es cape. What he found amazed him. The biggest shock came when he managed to get to Coronation Street and discovered it wasn\u2019t in Weatherfield at all, but was a set in the Granada Studios. But when he furtively returned to Hogden\u2019s and told his fellow discipl es what he had discovered, he was dismissed as a lunatic. \u2018You should never have left,\u2019 they told him. \u2018It\u2019s not safe out there.

Source: The allegory of the cave in The Republic by Plato (360 BCE) The story of the Weatherfieldians is clearly an allegory. But what do its various elements represent? There are many ways of translating the parable. There are some who claim that the world of ordinary exp erience is an illusion, and that the doors to the real world are opened by sacred drugs or practices of meditation. People who claim to have seen the truth this way are usually dismissed as dope -heads or wackos; but they think it is we who are the fools , trapped as we are within the limited world of sense experience.

They may not literally believe that soap operas are true, but they do accept uncritically received wisdom, what they read in the papers and watch on the television.

Others think it equally mad to maintain that, actually, he\u2019s quite a smart guy. This raises the question of what the real-world counterpart of St Hilda Hogden House is.

Indeed, the quest for extinction had been the one goal which had given some shape and purpose to her life over the last half century. Now she finally had the antidote to the elixir. She had taken it a few days ago and could feel herself rapidly weakening. All that remained now was for her to make sure that no oneelse was condemned to life as she had been. The elixir itself had long been destroyed. Now, she took the piece of paper that specified the formula and tossed it into the fire. As she watched it burn, for the first time in decades, she smiled.

The story of Vitalia turns this conventional wisdom on its head and suggests that immortality would be a curse. We need death to give shape and meaning to life. Without it, we would find life pointless. On this view, if hell is eternal damnation, the eternity of life in Hades would be enough to make it a place of punishment. It is surprising how few people who think eternal life would be desirable think hard about what it would entail. That is understandable. What we primarily want is simply more life.

But we know full well that these thoughts aren\u2019t causing the actions. My body and brain were already gearing up to order a beer.

Epiphenom enalism is the view that thoughts and other mental events do not cause anything in the physical world, including our actions. Rather, the brain and the body work like some kind of purely physical machine, and our conscious experience is a byproduct, cau sed by the machine but not affecting it. The reason why this would be the end of the world is that everything we seem to believe about what we are apparently depends on the idea that thoughts do cause actions.

The imaginary land of Epiphenia is designed to test the idea that no one can live with the truth of epiphenomenalism. The suggestion is that people could come to see epiphenomenal -ism as some banal truth which does not affect the way they live their lives. The crucial point is that how it feels to be an Epiphen is exactly the same as what it feels like to be a human being. In both cases, thought accompanies action in just the same way. The only difference is that Epiphens do not believe their thoughts are doing any causing. Is it really possible, however, to divorce what we believe about the link between thought and action and how we actually live?

And the attitude of the developed world is, on this view , as callous as Roger\u2019s. We have enough food and medicine for everyone, but we would rather enjoy luxuries and let others die than forfeit our \u2018extra biscuit\u2019 and save them.

If it seems cruel not to make the effort to get another person on to the boat, it seems even crueller to deny supplies to those already plucked from the water. The image is powerful and the message shocking. But does the analogy stand up? Some might say the lifeboat scenario neglects the importance of property rig hts. Goods are placed on a lifeboat for those who need them, and nobody has a greater claim to them than anyone else. So we start from the assumption that anything other than an equal distribution according to need is unfair unless proven otherwise. In the real world, however, food and other goods are not just sitting there waiting to be distributed. Wealth is created and earned.

So if I refuse to give some of my surplus to someone else, I am not unfairly appropriating what is due to him, I am simply keeping what is rightfully mine. However, even if the analogy is altered to reflect this fact, the apparent immorality does not disappear. Let us imagine that all the food and supplies on the boat belong to the individuals in it. Nevertheless, once in the boat, and once the need of the drowning woman is recognised, wouldn\u2019t it still be wrong to say, \u2018Let her die. These biscuits are mine!\u2019? As long as there is enough surplus to provide for her too, the fact that she is dying should make us give up some of our priv ately owned provisions for her.

For all anyone knew, either or both boxes were empty, or each contained very different things.

Source: Philosophical Investigations by Ludwig Wittgenstein (Blackwell, 1953)This odd little game is a variation on one outlined by the maverick Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein. For Wittgenstein, however, all language use is a kind of game, in that it relies upon a combination of rules and conventions, not all of which can be explicitly stated, and which only players of the game really understand. The question Wittgenstein invites us to ask is: does the word \u2018beetle\u2019 refer to anything? And if it doesn\u2019t, what does it mean?

As with Ludwig and Bertie\u2019s containers, no one else can look inside it; only I can. Nor can I describe it in terms of anything that is outside of myself.

This is highly counter -intuitive, since we assume that by \u2018pain\u2019 we mean some kind of private sensation. But the beetle argument seems to show that it cannot mean that. Rather, the rules that govern the correct use of \u2018pain\u2019, and thus also its meaning, are public.

This might seem odd, since, if God is all-powerful, surely there is literally nothing he can\u2019t do? Aquinas and the vast majority of his successors disagreed. They had little choice. Like most believers, Aquinas thought that belief in God was consistent with rationality. That is not to say that rationality provides all the sufficient reasons to believe in God, or that by applying rationality we ca n exhaust all there is to say about the divine.

The problem with things such as square circles is that they are logically impossible. Since a circle is by definition a one-sided shape and a square a four-sided one, and a four -sided one-sided shape is a contradiction in terms, then a square circle is a contradiction in terms and impossible in all possible worlds. This much rationality demands. So if we are to say that God\u2019s omnipotence means he can create shapes such as square circles, then we wave goodbye to rationality.

If we accept this concession, however, the door opens to rational scrutiny of the concept of God and the coherence of belief in him. By accepting that belief in God must be in harmony with reason, the religious believer is obliged to take seriously claims that belief in God is irrational. Such arguments include the claim that God\u2019s supposed all -loving nature is incompatibl e with the unnecessary suffering we see in the world; or that divine punishment is immoral given that God is ultimately responsible for human nature.

The alternative route for believers is even more unpalatable: deny that reason has anything to do with it and bank solely on faith instead. What appears contrary to reason is thus dismissed as simply a divine mystery. Such a rou te is open to us, but to abandon reason so readily in onesphere of life while living as a reasonable person the rest of the time is arguably to live a divided life. See also 8.

As his stomach rumbling grew intolerable, he thought he had hit upon a solution. Since it was clearly irrational to starve himself to death, wouldn\u2019t it be rational to make a random choice between the two Kwik-E-Marts? He should simply toss a coin, or see which direction he felt like heading off in. That was surely more rational than sitting at home and doing nothing.

Is this as empty as the injunction to know both cats and dogs, a genuine insight, or just plain incoherent? It might be thought that it can never be rational to do something irrational. Consider, for example, if the supposedly irrational thing is to make a decision on the toss of a coin. If we say it is rational to do this, what we must be saying is that making the decision on the toss of a coin is rational after all, not that it is an irrational act we are rational to perform.

For example, if you prefer red wine t o white, that is not irrational, but nor is it rational. The preference is not based on reasons at all, but on tastes. Once we accept this, the paradox disappears. Buridan\u2019s conclusion is that it is sometimes rational to adopt non-rational procedures for decision-making. In his case, since reason cannot determine which supermarket he should visit, but he needs to visit one, it is perfectly reasonable to make a random selection. No paradox there.

        "ere. The moral of the story is, however, extremely important. Many people argue that rationality is overrated, because not everything we do can be explained or determined rationally. This is to use the right reasons to reach the wrong conclusion. Rationality remains sovereign because only reason can tell us when we should adopt rational or non -rational procedures. For example, if a herbal medicine works, then rationality may tell us we should take it, even if we cannot rationally explain how it works. But rationality would caution against taking homeopathic medicines, sinc e there are no reasons to think they are effective. Accepting that it can be rational to be non -rational does not open the door to irrationality. See also 6. Wheel of fortune 16. Racing tortoises 42. Take the money and run 94. The Sorites tax **26.

It does seem unarguable that pain is i ndeed a bad thing. But how bad is it? This thought experiment challenges the intuition that pain in itself is a very bad thing; it separates the sensation of pain from the anticipation and memory of pain. Our patient, because he does not remember his pa in, does not have anything bad to associate with his imminent pain, and thus does not fear it either. Nevertheless, at the moment of feeling the pain, it is intense and very real.

This is not least because the person feeling the pain neither fears nor remembers it. What makes causing pain usually so wrong, then, must be something to do with the way in which it scars us in the longer run and creates fear. Perhaps this is how we should understand suffering. For example, a sharp, momentary pain in a tooth is unpleasant, but it passes and doesn\u2019t affect our lives much. But if you have such a pain regularly, you really do suffer. It is not so much that the pains add up.

If this is right, to answer Bentham\u2019s question about animals we need to know not only whether animals feel pain, but whether they have the memory and anticipation of pain that is necessary to suffering. Many animals surely do. A dog that is constantly mistreated does seem to be suffering. But less complex animals that live onl y in the moment arguably cannot suffer in that way. Could it be that a fish, for example, hanging from a rod, is not really suffering a slow and painful death, but is merely experiencing a series of disconnected painful moments?

It applies not only to sending news to parents, but to cancelling orders for nuclear attack. The issue at stake is whether we can be said to have fulfilled our duty if the consequence we intend for our action does not come about. In general, it would seem to be too harsh a rule to say that the answer is always no. Sue did everything she could to ensure her letters got home, yet still they did not. How can she be responsible for that failure when it was not in her power to do any more? That is why we don\u2019t hold people responsible for failures if they did the best they could.

The idea of what is reasonable to expect is crucial here. If we were talking about an order to cancel a nuclear at tack, then our expectation of the checks and extra measures that should be taken would be much higher.

If ethics does not concern itself with consequences at all, however, we have a different absurdity, for how can it not matter what actually happens as the result of our actions?

The most crucial parallel is that, in both cases, in order to free themselves from their unwanted role as a human life -support machine, both the pregnant woman and Dick have to do something which will lead to the death of the being dependent on them. How you think Dick should behave therefore has conseque nces for how you think the pregnant woman should behave.

The parallels provide a way for pro -abortionists to tackle head-on the accusation that abortion results in killing by claiming that, nonetheless, the pregnant woman has a right to end the foetus\u2019s life. Of course, arguments can be made on the other side. The foetus is helpless, it is said, which is more reason, not less, to protect it. The inconvenience to the pregnant woman is much less than that to the effectively imprisoned and immobilised Dick. And it can even be claimed that Dick is obliged to st ay connected to the violinist for nine months. Sometimes a combination of irresponsible behaviour and bad luck results in serious consequences which we cannot just walk away from.

There is a theory in the philosophy of personal identity known as psychological reductionism.

Psychological continuity requires various things, in cluding a certain continuity of belief, memory, personality and intention. All these things may change, but they do so gradually, not all at once. The self is merely the combination of these various factors: it is not a separate entity. But surely the individual self cannot be \u2018made up of\u2019 things such as belief, memory, personality and intention? Rather, the self is what has these things, and so in a sense must come first. For example, say that you remember climbing the Eiffel Tower. To remember this is to presuppose that you visited the tower.

One answer is brute physical strength. Now, consider the baseball cap. Worn in the traditional style it offers protection against the sun and also the gaze of aggressive competitors. By turning the cap around, the male is signalling that he doesn\u2019t need this protection: he is tough enough to face the elements and the gaze of any who might threaten him. \u2018Second, inverting the cap is a gesture of non-conformity. Primates live in highly ordered social structures. Playing by the rules is considered essential. Turning the cap around shows that the male is above the rules that constrain his competitors and again signals that he has a supe rior strength. \u2018Next?\u2019 Evo",

It is loved and loathed in equal measure and intensity. Its essential premise is surely uncontroversial: human bein gs are evolved creatures, and just as our bodies have been shaped by natural selection to make us fit for survival in the savannah, so too our minds have been moulded by the same needs. The controversy concerns just how far you take this. The more zealo us evolutionary psychologists claim that virtually every aspect of human behaviour can ultimately be explained in terms of the selective advantage it gave our ancestors in their Darwinian struggle for survival.

If you buy into this, it is not difficult to come up with plausible sounding evolutionary explanations for any behaviour you choose. The experiment in the story of Dr Kipling was to see if I \u2013 Kipling\u2019s scriptwriter \u2013 could come up with an evolutionary explanation of a random piece of human behaviour. In real life it took me only slightly longer to do so than it did Kipling in his imaginary talk. The trouble is that this suggests these are not genuine explanations at all, but \u2018just so\u2019 stories. Evolutionary psychologists simply invent \u2018explanations\u2019 on the basis of no more than a prior theoretical commitment.

How would we know, for ex ample, that the inverted baseball cap is a signal of strength rather than, say, a signal of a weakness to resist peer pressure? Evolutionary psychologists are well aware of this criticism, of course. They argue that their accounts are much more than \u2018just so\u2019 stories. For sure, they may generate hypotheses by indulging in the kind of speculation exemplified by Kipling\u2019s off -the-cuff explanation. But these hypotheses are then tested. However, there seem to be serious limits on how far testing is possible. What you can test are the predictions concerning human behaviour generated by evolutionary hypotheses.

What you can\u2019t do, however, is test whether any particular behaviour, such as inverting one\u2019s baseball cap, is a manifestation of this tendency to display strength or is the result of something quite different. The big a rgument between evolutionary psychologists and their opponents is thus mainly concerned with how much can be explained by our evolutionary past. Critics say there are better ways of explaining most of our behaviour. Supporters claim that we just don\u2019t want to acknowledge how much we are the products of our animal history. See also 10.

Must we end up with a robot that looks and acts like human beings? Or could it perhaps be just a box that can answer questions? Does a calculator have a mind, though one that understands only a very limi ted range of problems? Turing proposed a test, the one which was passed by Simone. In essence, the test says that if the responses of a computer and a humanare indistinguishable, then the grounds for attributing a mind to the computer are as good as they are for attributing it to the person. And since we think the grounds for attributing minds to other people are sound so are the grounds for attributing minds to computers that pass the test.

However, since the test is based entirely on how people and compu ters respond, it is arguably unable to distinguish between a machine that simulates intelligence and one that genuinely has it. This is no accident or oversight. Just as we cannot look directly into the minds of others, but must look to their words and dee ds for signs of inner life, so we could not look directly into the mind of a machine. This is why Simone\u2019s legal action has some force. Her case is based on the idea that it would be discriminatory to demand a higher standard of proof for her own intellige nce than that which we demand for humans. After all, how else could we determine whether Simone has a mind than to see if she acts mindfully? And yet, the distinction between a simulation and the real thing seems clear enough.

Depending on your point of view, it could be scepticism, defeatism or realism: since we could not know whether a computer was faking intelligence or was really intelligent, we have no choice but to treat real minds and simulated minds alik e. The precautionary principle holds sway: intelligence is real until proven otherwise. The more radical response is that the apparently clear distinction doesn\u2019t hold up. If you simulate intelligence well enough, what you end up with is intelligence. This is the computer as method actor. Just as the thespian who inhabits the role of a madman deeply enough becomes mad, so a machine that perfectly replicates the functions of intelligence becomes intelligent. You are what you do.

We must, as Voltaire suggested, defend to the death the rights of people to say what we may strongly disagree with.

It seems that the outcomes of our actions have a retrospective effect on whether or not we were truly responsible for them. One way in which we evade responsibility for our actions is to hide behind the advice of others. Indeed, one of the main reasons we ask other people what they think is that we hope they agree with what we want to do, and so provide external validation for our choice.

All this really does is subtly shift what we are responsible for. Instead of being purely responsible for what we choose to do, we also become responsible for our choice of advisers, and our willingness to follow their advice. For example, if I ask a priest and he advises me poorly, I am responsible not only for what I end up doing, but for choosing a bad adviser and accepting what he says. That is why the kind of defence offered by Mary, Mungo and Midge is inadequate. However, before we dismiss their pleas as mere excuses, we have to take seriously the fact that we are not experts in all domains and we sometimes need to ask the advice of others who know better.

After all, what more could I do than choose my adviser as well as could reasonably be expected? Perhaps then we need to allow for a continuum of responsibility, whereby we are less responsible for those choices we are n ot qualified to make, fully responsible for those we are, and something in between for most areas of life where we know something but not everything.

The only way to deny that is to suggest that there is something inherently violent or wicked about the Palestinians, a claim which is surely as racist as the myth of Semitic wickedness which has led to so many Jews being oppressed over the centuries.

The idea that artists had to have a hand in creating their work was challenged in 1917, when Duchamp signed and exhibited a urinal. \u2018Found\u2019 objects, or \u2018re adymades\u2019, had just as much claim to the status of art as the Mona Lisa. In this historical perspective, it would seem that the fact that Moore didn\u2019t carve Stone\u2019s exhibit should not matter. And yet it seems it does. The artist can be separated from her w ork, but not eliminated altogether. Consider the Mona Lisa. Our admiration for it may not depend on knowing what Leonardo had in mind while he was painting it, but it surely is rooted in our knowledge that it is a human artefact. Even with Duchamp\u2019s uri nal, our awareness that it was not created as a work of art but that Duchamp selected it and placed it in the context of art is essential to us seeing it as art.

So it is no wonder that it does make a difference to Stone whether or not Moore carved the rock. It doesn\u2019t change what she sees, but it transforms how she sees it. Does this justify downgrading the rock to \u2018non-art\u2019? For sure, there are many forms of appreciation no longer appropriate for it: we ca nnot admire the skill of its creator, how it fits into his wider oeuvre or vision, how it responded to and shaped the history of sculpture and so on. But we can still appreciate its formal features \u2013 its beauty, symmetry, colours and balance \u2013 as well as respond to what it suggests to us about nature or sensual experience.

But if it shares some, and those are among the most important and valuable, why should this matter? If we accept this we then go one step further than Duchamp. First, art was created by artists. Then, with Duchamp, art became only what the artists decreed was art. Finally, art became whatever is seen as art. But if art really is in the eye of the beholder, hasn\u2019t the very notion of art become so thin as to be meaningless? Surely my deciding that my spice rack is a work of art can\u2019t just make it art? If art is to mean anything at all, don\u2019t we need a more rigorous way t o distinguish art from non -art?

The score is, in essence, a kind of code which needs to be inscribed somewhere to continue to exist. But it is the code, not the somewhere, which makes it what it is. Might this not also be true of the human self ? The notes and keys that make up the individual personality could be the thoughts, memories and character traits that together define who we are.

Such thoughts lay behind the emergence of a theory of mind known as functionalism in the 1950s. To have a mind was not, on this view, a matter of having a certain kind of biological organ, such as a brain, but to be able to perform the functions of minds, such as understanding, judging and communicating. The plausibility of this account is severely diminished, however, by the story of John and Jun. Here, instead of consciousness or mind in general, one parti cular function of mind is under scrutiny: understanding a language. Jun\u2019s clairvoyant booth functions as though there were someone in it who understands Chinese. Therefore, according to the functionalist, we should say that understanding of Chinese is goin g on.

The conclusion then seems to be that functionalism is wrong: it is not enough to perform the functions of a mind to have a mind. It might be objected that, although John doesn\u2019t understand Chinese, his computer must do. However, imagine that instead of a computer, John works with a complex instruction manual, of which he is now a quick user due to his long experience. This manual simply tells him which replies to write out in response to the comments that come in. The result from the point of view of the person behind the screen would be the same, yet obviously there is no understanding of Chinese going on in this case.

If it is no use zooming in on the computer to locate understanding, it seems even more futile to zoom out to the whole system of booth, John and computer, and say that as a whole it understands Chinese. This isn\u2019t quite as crazy as it sounds. After all, I understand English, but I\u2019m not sure it makes sense to say that my neurons, tongue or ears understand English. But the booth, John and the computer do not form the same kind of closely integrated whole as a person, and so the idea that by putting the three together you get understanding seems unpersuasive.

Whenever he feels convinced he knows the name of the winning horse, he is always right. The trouble is that Paul has no idea where this con viction comes from. The evidence that it provides a reliable route to knowledge comes solely from his results to date, but this is consistent with the mechanism itself being deeply unreliable.

In ancient Greece, Plato thought that everything we learn we in a sense already know, while today Noam Chomsky leads those who believe that the grammar required for language learning is innate, not learned. On the other hand, in the seventeenth century John Locke argued that the mind was a \u2018blank slate\u2019 at birth, an idea developed by the behaviourist B. F. Skinner 300 years later. It is obvious that we can come up with ideas beyond our experience in one sense at least. Leonardo da Vinci could not have dreamt up the helicopter if his mind could conceive only what he had already experienced.

And could other beings not see colours that simply are not on our visible spectrum, colours we cannot bring to mind, no matter how hard we try? The experiments on Muddy and Waters could perhaps shed some light on these questions. Most would agree with the Scottish philosopher David Hume that those on Muddy could imag ine the missing shade of blue.

Remember how, as a child, it seemed so surprising that green was a combination of yellow and blue. It seems implausible to assume that we could simply imagine the colour that needs to be added to yellow to produce green. If you were to bet on the results of the test, you would probably say that it would support the central role of experience i n learning. Even if those born on Waters could imagine blue, that still leaves one question unanswered.

Hence we have a paradox, named after William Newcomb, the physicist who first devised it. Two lines of reasoning, both seemingly impeccable, lead to contradictory conclusions. One concludes that he should take only the closed box; the other that he may as well take both.

But before we come to that, we should ask the more fundamental question of what gives us the right to make binding decisions on behalf of our future selves. The obvious answer is that since we can, of course, make decisions for ourselves, there is no reason why these shouldn\u2019t include ourselves in the future. Indeed, we make such decisions all the time, when we sign up for twenty-five yearmortgages, pension plans, to have and to hold till death us do part, or even just for a two-year work contract.

Alongside this duty to make good our promises, though, there must also surely be a concomitant right to change our minds as our circumstances and beliefs change. Many people, for example, say things that begin \u2018shoot me if I ever ...\u2019, especially when young. And although it is often just a figure of speech, it is frequently said with the utmost sincerity, and often by people who are of the age of majority and so considered adults capable of making decisions about thei r own futures. To hold people to these vows, however, would be ridiculous. But why, twenty years later, is it ridiculous not to punish, if not actually kill, someone for going back on their vow not to vote Republican, but reasonable to expect them to try t o maintain their marriage vows?

        "Republican, but reasonable to expect them to try t o maintain their marriage vows? There are significant differences. A marriage vow, like a mortgage agreement, involves responsibility and commitment to a third party. If we go back on these, others suffer. If we change our minds about matters of politics or religion, however, we do not, on the whole, breach any agreement we have with others. However, the fact that we do think it reasonable to change our minds should make us see these other long term commitments as also being less than absolute. For the plain truth is that we change. In a very real sense, we are not the same people that we were many years in the past. So when we make promises on behalf of our future selves, we are to some degree making promises for someone other than who we now are. And that means our promises should not be seen as morally binding. How does this affect the issue of living wills? The key difference here is that these documents are there to pr",

The key difference here is that these documents are there to prepare for the eventuality that no future self will be competent to make a choice. In that situation, the best qualified person to do so may well be the past self rather than a present other. That\u2019s the answer the senator should give. Whether or not it is good enough to make Drew replace the safety catch is another matter. See also 27. Duties done 44. Till death us do part 88. Total lack of recall 97. Moral luck **44.

But surely it was the only rational course of action to take? Something doesn\u2019t sound right. Two people are trying rationally to decide what is in their best interests. If they both act in a certain way, the best outcome for both of them is assured. But if one acts differently, he secures all the advantage and the other is left worse off. And so, to insure against this happening, neither does what is best if both do it, and so both end up with an outcome which is worse than it could have been.

Hence the typical example involves prisoners kept in separate cells, unable to communicate. But the same problems can arise even for people who share the same bed. The fact is that people do secretly betray the trust of their partners, often undiscovered for years. The dilemma reveals the limitations of the ratio nal pursuit of self-interest. If we all individually decide to do what is best for each one of us, we may well all end up worse off than we could have been if we had co-operated. But to cooperate effectively, even if our motive for doing so is self-interest, we need to trust one another. And trust is not founded on rational arguments.

What is left of a gardener after you have removed all that is visible and tangible about him? For sure, Stanley cannot prove that such a greenfingered ghost does not exist, but he can rightly ask what purpose it serves to continue believing in something so nebulous.

First, the world runs itself according to physical laws. God is not required to turn on the rain or raise the sun each day. But, says the Livingstonian believer, it was God who lit the blue touch paper and set the universe in motion. Then, however, we notice that nature is far from gentle and kind. There is terrible suffering and downright evil in the world. Where is the good God now? Ah, the believer maintains, God made things as good as possible, but human sin can mess things up.

They had heard this word being used whenever a rabbit was present, so Lapin was about to write \u2018gavagai = rabbit\u2019. But then his assistant interjected. For all they knew, couldn\u2019t \u2018gavagai\u2019 mean something else, such as \u2018undetached rabbit part\u2019 or \u2018Look! Rabbit!\u2019?

Or perhaps \u2018gavagai\u2019 were only observed rabbits and unseen rabbits had a different name? The possibilities seemed fanciful, but Lapin had to admit that they were all consistent with what they had observed so far. But how could they know which one was correct? They could make more observations, but in order to rule out all the possibilities they would have to know more or less everything about the tribe, how they lived and the other words they used. But then how could they even begin their dictionary? Source: Word and Object by W.V.O.

The Spanish, for example, talk about the \u2018marcha\u2019 of a city or party. This is similar but not identical to the Irish word \u2018craic\u2019, which is also hard to translate exactly i nto English. The closest equivalent might be \u2018buzz\u2019 or \u2018good time feel\u2019 but to know what \u2018marcha\u2019 or \u2018craic\u2019 means you really have to get under the skin of the language and culture to which they belong. Similarly, there is not one translation of the ver b \u2018to be\u2019 in Spanish. Rather, there are two, \u2018ser\u2019 and \u2018estar\u2019, and which one you need to use depends on differences in the meaning of \u2018be\u2019 which the English lexicon does not reflect.

You also need to know that it means \u2018handcuffs\u2019, and have an awareness of the traditional Spanish machismo. What the story of the \u2018gavagai\u2019 suggests is that all words are like \u2018craic\u2019, \u2018marcha\u2019, \u2018ser\u2019 and \u2018esposas\u2019 in that their meanings are tied intimately to the practices of a culture and the other words in the language. Whenever we translate a word into another language we lose these crucial contexts. Most of the time, we can get away with this, since the meanings are sim ilar enough for us to be able to use the word and function in the community of speakers that use it. Hence if Lapin thinks of \u2018gavagai\u2019 as \u2018rabbit\u2019, he\u2019ll probably get on fine, even if there are subtle differences in meaning between the two.

But to underst and the true meaning of \u2018gavagai\u2019 he must focus on the language and community in which it is embedded, not his English concepts and practices. Why does this matter? We are apt to think of words as functioning as a kind of label for ideas or objects, which enables people who speak different first languages to talk about the same things and have the same ideas. It\u2019s just that they use different words to do so. On this model, words have a one -to-one relation to their meanings or the things they refer to. But i f we take the \u2018gavagai\u2019 story seriously, we need to change this picture radically. Words do not stand in a one-to-one relation with things and ideas.

Truth is about a correspondence between a sentence and a state of affairs. But this simple relation is not possible if the meaning of a sentence depends on the language and culture in which it is embedded. Instead of a simple correspondence between sentence and facts, there is a complex web of relations between facts, sentence, the wider language and culture.

For some, Riefenstahl was a brilliant filmmaker who put her talent in the service of evil; for others, the f ilms are artistic as well as moral failures. Oscar Wilde described one extreme position on this general debate when he wrote, \u2018There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written or badly written.\u2019 Wilde\u2019s claim was that art was au tonomous from morality, and so to apply the standards of ethics to art was simply a mistake. Most would not go so far.

It would be perfectly consistent to argue that De Puta Madre is an artistic triumph and a moral disgrace, and that the demands of morality trump those of art. In that case, we might want to ban a film we nonetheless recognise as having great artistic merit. At the other end of the spectrum from Wilde is the view that artistic and moral merit are intimately connected. Keats wrote that \u2018beauty is truth, truth beauty\u2019.

This vignette is not intended as an attack on Americans, but as a striking example of a form of fallacious thinking that even the smartest minds fall foul of. Barbara and Wally have made what the Oxford philosopher Gilbert Ryle called a category mistake. They have thought of Oxford University as though it were the same kind of thing as the colleges, libraries and museums which comprise it: an institution housed in a specific building. But the university is not that kind of thing at all. There is no one place or building which you can point t o and say \u2018that is the university\u2019.

It is neither a single material nor immaterial thing. We should not be misled by language and assume that because it is a singular noun it is a singular object. Ryle thought that the most common way of thinking about the mind made a similar category mistake. Again, we have a singular noun \u2013 the mind \u2013 and so we tend to think there mustbe a singular thing which the noun labels. If we think that, though, we end up with one of two absurdities.

To say something has a mind is to say it wants, desires, understands, thinks and so on. Because we do all these things w e say we have minds.

The good bribe** The Prime Minister liked to think of himself as a \u2018pretty straight kind of guy\u2019. He genuinely despised corruption and sleaze in government and wa nted to run a cleaner, more honest administration. Something had happened, however, that presented him with a real dilemma. At a Downing Street reception, a businessman known for his lack of scruples, but who did not have a criminal or civil conviction aga inst him, took the PM aside.

Take a narrow utilitarian view, where the morally desirable outcome is that which benefits the largest number of people, and of course the Prime Minister should accept the bribe. The moral mathematics is simple: if he accepts, hundreds of thousands get their clean water, a rich man gets to be called \u2018sir\u2019 and the only price to be paid is the irritation of those who balk at the sight of a greedy quasi -criminal being honoured by the Queen. If you start from principles of integrity and due process however, then it is equally obvious that the Prime Minister should resist. Affairs of state must be governed by due process.

Due process and the rule of law are surely important for any democratic and open society, but if bending the rules has overwhelmingly good consequences and only minor bad ones, isn\u2019t it foolish or even immoral to stick rigidly to them? The nub of the problem is a phenomenon known as moral self -indulgence. The Prime Minister is keen to run a clean government, and that means keeping himself free from any taint of corruptio n.

It is an indulgence for which others will pay in disease and walking for miles to collect water. The Prime Minister may be aware of this, however, but still have many reservations. For if he allows himself to think in this way, what other corruptions will follow? Why not lie to the electorate, if by doing so he can win their support for a just war they would otherwise oppose?

In that film, the hero, Neo, played by Keanu Reeves, was spared the indignity of having no body, but his situation was ess entially the same as Brian\u2019s. He thought he was living in the real world when, in fact, his brain was simply being fed information to present that illusion. Really, he was in a pod, immersed in a kind of amniotic fluid. The sceptical doubt that we might be victims of such a whole-scale illusion is much older.

Indeed, a recent argument has even suggested that it is overwhelmingly probable that we are living in a vi rtual reality environment, not perhaps as brains in vats, but as artificially created intelligences. The argument is that, given time, we or another civilisation will almost certainly be able to create artificial intelligences and virtual-reality environments for them to live in. Further, because these simulated worlds do not require the huge amount of natural resources to keep them going that biological organisms do, there is almost no limit to how many such environments could be created.

This would probably see the population of the village rise from 100 to 150 and the quality of life index, which measures subjective as well as objective factors, rise modestly from an average of 2.4 to 3.2. The second plan did include a non -coercive birth-control programme. This would see the population remain stable at 100, but the average quality of life would rise to 4.0. Given that only those with a quality of life ranked as 1.0 or lower consider their lives not to be worth living at all, the first plan would lead to there being more worthwhile lives than the second, whereas the second would result in fewer lives, but ones which were even more fulfilled. Which plan would make the best use of Carol\u2019s money?

Source: Part four of Reasons and Persons by Derek Parfit (Oxford University Press, 1984) Carol\u2019s dilemma is not simply one of choosing between quality or quantity, for when we use things such as quality of life indices we are quantifying quality. That is just as complicated as it sounds. What is Car ol trying to achieve? There are three plausible answers. One is to increase the number of worthwhile lives. Another is to increase the total amount of quality of life. And the third is to create the conditions for the most worthwhile forms of life as possible. Consider the first option. Clearly, if she goes with the no -birth-control plan, there will be more lives worth living as a result. But is this a desirable outcome? If we think it is, it seems we are led to an absurd conclusion. For since all lives other than the most wretched are worth living, that would mean we should always try to bring as many people into the world as possible, just as long as the qual",

But would it really be a good thing if we trebled the population of Britain, for example, impoverishing it in the process, in order to bring more lives worth living into the world? The second possible goal is to increase the total amount of quality of life. Again, the first plan achieves this. Although the maths can only approximate to the reality, we can see roughly how 150 lives each with a 3.2 quality of life rating scores a total of 480 \u2018points\u2019, whereas 100 lives each with a 4.0 rating scores only 400. So there is more quality of life under the first plan. But this too can lead to absurdity.

(The rating system used here is fictitious.) That leaves the third possibility: create the conditions for the most worthwhileand satisfying forms of human life possible, and don\u2019t worry about trying to maximise either the total number of people o r total amount of quality of life. It\u2019s better to have fewer people genuinely content than many more barely satisfied. Although that sounds like a reasonable conclusion, it has implications in other areas of life and ethics which some find more disturbing.

The principle of double effect states that it can be morally acceptable to do something in order to bring about a good, even if you can foresee that will also bring about something bad, as long as the intention is the good and not the bad consequence. The key is that to foresee is not the same as to intend, and it is intent that counts. The principle can get a bad press because it looks li ke a way of justifying awkward moral choices.

        "University Press, 2001) This parable could be taken simply as a lesson about forward planning in business. But it is more interesting than that, for the tale can be seen as mirroring a serious dilemma of much wider concern: how do we respond to the environmental threats facing us today? Take climate change. Experts agree that it is happening and that it is probably man-made. But there are no measures we can realistically take now that will stop it altogether. The Kyoto agreement, for example, would only delay it by about six years. However, the cost to the United States alone of implementing the agreement would be the equivalent of the money required to extend provision of clean drinking water to all the world\u2019s population. You have therefore to ask whether the cost of Kyoto is worth paying. The point is not that, without Kyoto, the US would in fact provide clean water for all.

Could we end up with a situation where we merely delay the inevitable at the cost of economic growth, thus depriving future generations of the funds they would need to sort out the problems they will inherit? It can\u2019t be better to postpone the problem of global warming if doing so merely leaves us less well equipped to confront it when it starts to hurt. That is not to say that we should do nothing about global warming. It is merely to point out that we should make sure what we do is effective and doesn\u2019t inadvertently make things worse. That requires us to take into account more than just the spread of environmental damage, but future generations\u2019 ability to deal with it.

This would seem to be just common sense, but it is intuitively unappealing to those who care about the environ ment, for three reasons. First, it suggests it is sometimes better to let the Earth get more polluted in the short term. Second, it emphasises the role of economic growth in providing the source of solutions to problems. That emphasis on finance and economics is anathema to many greens. Third, it is often linked to the idea that future technologies will help bring solutions. And technology is seen by many environmentalists as a source of our problems, not their solution. Those three reasons might explain why Greens resist the argument, but not why they should.

But now, as he stood ready to test it out, he was questioning whether the whole endeavour was a terrible mistake. The machine, which he had first come across as a piece of science fiction in a late twentieth-century radio programme, would enable whoever went into it to see their true place in the universe. The idea of the original fiction was that anyone who used the machine would find the fact of their own insignificance so crushing that it would destroy their very soul.

He, like Camus\u2019s Sisyphus, condemned to push a boulder endlessly uphill only to see it roll back down again, would be able to confront the absurdity of his own insignificance and prevail. And yet, now he was about to test it out, he did feel more than a little appr ehensive. Could he really accept his own infinitesimal smallness in the grand scheme of things?

On the one hand, it invites us to imagine what would be the case if we entered the vortex, but on the other, the whole point of the hypothetical device is that we cannot imagine what it shows us. Nevertheless, there is still some value in considering what effects the vortex might have. In The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy, the source of the vortex idea, one person does survive the experience. Zaphod Beeblebrox walks out calmly, saying the machine had showed him only what a \u2018terrific and great guy\u2019 he was. But we are left unsure whether Beeblebrox has really survived the machine or whether what he saw presented a distorted picture of his own significance. Could he have survived the real thing?

All this is true, but it does not show that the only true measure of something\u2019s significance or value is its impact on the universe as a whole.

She had learned a lot from them, skills virtually no one her age had, such as how to skin a rabbit and make tasty, simple dishes from offal. So when she heard a scream of brakes one day outside her suburban semi in Hounslow, and went outside to find that Tiddles, the family cat, had been struck by a car, her first thoughts were not just of regret and sadness, but practicalities.

Sometimes the flesh they dine on has been produced from animals kept in terrible conditions. Some farm animals, such as pigs, are more intelligent than many household pets. Yet eating certain types of meat is seen as repulsive. Many Britons think eating horses or dogs is barbaric, whereas British Muslims think it is eatin g pigs which is repellent. And eating pets is considered particularly repugnant. Rabbit stew is perfectly acceptable, just as long as it isn\u2019t the rabbit you gave a name to and kept in a hutch. Is there any moral basis to these judgements, or are they no m ore than culturally conditioned reflex reactions?

After all, we do think there is something immoral about wilfully wasting resources when so many in the world are poor. So if eating meat is not wrong, and a source of meat becomes available, discarding it would seem to be wrong \u2013 not, eating it. On this ac count, Delia is a kind of moral hero, doing the good deed most others do not have the courage to. It might be objected that to eat a pet is to betray the trust that the relationship with it was based on. You cannot just flip from being a friend and protect or to pragmatic farmer.

Although most of the books\u2019 readers are children, Pullman says that they seem to have no problem accepting the naturalness of this. So perhaps the question of whether an animal is friend or food presents a false dichotomy. It is not only morally acceptable to eat our dead pets, it is culpably wasteful not to. See also 5.

In the book of Genesis, the human characters seem to have a much more direct relationship with their maker than believers do today. God talks to people like Abraham as though they were literally sitting side by side. In such a world, the identity of the being instructing the murder would not be in doubt. In the world we know, no one can be so sure that they have ac tually heard God\u2019s word.

Faith does not just enter the picture when action is called for; faith is required to believe in the first place, despite the lack of evidence. Indeed, faith sometimes needs the devout to go beyond the evidence and believe what is contrary to all they previously thought was right and true; for instance, that God does not approve of pointless killing. This is not the faith that is often prea ched from the pulpits. That faith is a secure rock which provides the believer with a kind of calm, inner certainty.

If you remain unpersuaded, consider for a moment the people who believe that God wishes them to become suicide bombers, to murder prostitutes or to persecute an ethnic minority. Before you say that God could never command such wicked things , remember that the God of the three Abrahamic faiths not only ordered the sacrifice of Isaac, but also condoned the rape of a wife as punishment to the husband (2 Samuel 12), ordered the killing of followers of other religions (Deuteronomy 13) and sentenced blasphemers to death by stoning (Leviticus 24).

This e nables one person to connect themselves to another in such a way as to see exactly what that person sees, as she sees it.This is a remarkable experience for anyone. But for Cecilia it was even more startling. For when she saw the world as her friend Luke did, it was as though the world had turned inside out. For Luke, tomatoes were the colour she knew as blue.

But of course, because the differences were systematic, if it weren\u2019t for the U-View system no one would ever have known. After all, she rightly called tomatoes red just like everyone else.

There is no way to get behind your eyes to see what blue really looks like to you. I just have to assume that, given our similar biologies, there is not much difference between how we both see a clear summer sky. You might ask how it is then possible to know people are colour blind. The answer to that supports rather than weakens the case that the Cecilias of this world would live among us undetected.

When we say that a tom ato is red, the word \u2018red\u2019 does not then refer to a colour we perceive, but to a feature of the world that may appear very differently to others.

This seems to resolve the apparent paradox. It is true that collectively our fondness for flying is harmful: all the little emissions add up. It is also true that individual flights have a negligible impact: no individual little emission matters.

There is overwhelming evidence that the moon is a lump of rock, but we are not compelled by the evidence to reach this conclusion. The evidential gaps mean that the evidence can be made consistent even with the hypothesis that the moon is made of cheese. All we need to do is rearrange all the other interconnected beliefs we have in our web of understanding so that they too fit. Hence the need to reassess the power of microsco pes, the extent of corruption, and the veracity of the moon landings. For sure, what you end up with can sound pretty wild.

There\u2019s no easy answer to that, which perhaps in part explains why nearly half of all Americans think that the theory of evolution is bunkum too.

Ren\u00e9 Descartes, who first wrote that, took it to establish the existence of an immaterial soul or self. But critics have argued that in doing so he claimed more than his argument had proved. Our bizarre monologue shows why. The key point is that the certainty you get from \u2018I think, therefore I am\u2019 comes only in the moment of its thinking. It is indeed true that in order for there to be a thought, there must indeed be a thinker to have it. But that momentary certainty does not demonstrate that the same thinker exists over time, or is the same one who had a thought a few minutes ago. Indeed, it is consistent with the thinker popping into existence only for the time it takes to have the thought. This is how to make sense of the monologue.

Source: \u2018Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?\u2019 by Edmund Gettier, republished in Analytic Philosophy: An Anthology, edited by A. P. Martinich and D.

But was she right to say she knew them to be true? Many philosophers have argued that knowledge has three conditions. To know something, you must first believe it to be true. You can\u2019t know that Rome is the capital of Italy if you believe Milan is. Second, what you believe must be true. You can\u2019t know Milan is the capital of Italy if Rome is.

If you just happen for no good reason, to believe that Rome is the capital of Italy, and it turns out you are right, we should not say you had knowledge; it was just a lucky guess. Naomi had two true beliefs abou t the dead man. And she seemed justified in holding them. But it seems she really didn\u2019t know they were true. She did not know the man had a twin brother, who carried an identical key ring. So had the dead man been the twin of the man she had seen in the c af\u00e9, and had he neither visited the caf\u00e9 the day before nor carried the same key ring, she would still have claimed to have known the same two things about him, only this time she would have been wrong.

She has no idea which is which. The obvious solution to this problem seems to be t hat we need to tighten up the idea of justification. Naomi didn\u2019t know because her justification for claiming to know the two facts about the dead man was not strong enough. But if this is true, then we need to demand that knowledge has very strict conditi ons for justification of belief across the board. And that means we will find that almost all of what we think we know is not sufficiently justified tocount as knowledge. If Naomi really didn\u2019t know what she thought she knew about the dead man, then we don\u2019t really know much of what we think we know either. See also 1. The evil demon 3.

You should not give up the pursuit of a dang erous criminal in order to avoid trespassing. It is better to steal than starve to death. If we accept that, then the mere fact that what our President is being asked to do is contrary to international law does not settle the question of whether he should go ahead. The question is rather, are the circumstances so serious that there is no way to avoid a terrible outcome without resorting to illegal acts? If the calculations presented by the general are correct, then it would seem that the assassination would be justified.

Ho wever, as the overthrow of Saddam Hussein showed, the problem is that intelligence is far from infallible. The fact is that, although in hindsight we might wish we had acted earlier, we can never know for sure what the future will bring. Assassination migh t prevent ethnic cleansing and war. On the other hand, it might provoke greater unrest, or simply leave someone else to command the killing. The law of unintended consequences needs to be respected.

When we look back at ourselves in the past (rather than at our past selves), what gives us a sense that we are the same person is a certain degree of psychological connectedness and continuity.

This \u2018lost\u2019work would sell for millions and generate volumes of scholarship comparing it to the two other paintings van Gogh made of the same scene at different times. This pleased Joris van den Berg, for he, not van Gogh, had painted Avenue of Poplars at Dawn. Joris was an expert forger and he was certain that his latest creation would be authenticated as genuine. That would not only increase his wealth enormously but also give him tremendous professional satisfaction. Only a few close friends knew what Joris was up to. One expressed very serious moral misgivings, which Joris had brushed off. As far as he was concerned, if this p ainting was judged to be as good as a van Gogh original, then it was worth every penny that was paid for it.

Deceit, however, is not always to be decried. Indeed, sometimes a barefaced lie can be just what morality demands. If a racist thug, intent on violence, asks you if you know where any \u2018foreigners\u2019 live, you would do best to profess ignorance, rather than direct them to number 23.

We need to look at the broader picture if we are to assess the art of forgery. The imaginary tale of Joris van den Berg suggests a creditable way to defend his work. To put it in rather elevated terms , the forger is actually providing a service in reminding us of the true value of art and mocking the way in which the art market replaces aesthetic values with financial ones. The key point here is that the forger can succeed in one of two ways: he can produce a work which is as good as that of the master he is copying; or he can produce a work which is considered valuable simply because it is thought to be the work of a famous artist.

Could it be because prices on the art market are not determined by aesthetic merit but by fashion, reputation and celebrity? The sign ature of van Gogh on a work adds value in the same way that the moniker of David Beckham adds value to a football shirt. If this is the truth, then it is rich to protest that such a shoddy trade can in any way be made less pure by the work of a forger. In this light, the forger can be seen as a kind of guerrilla artist, fighting for the true values of creativity in a culture where art has been debased and commodified.

Those who remain within one tradition do not embody these ideals, and so, despite the talk of \u2018respect\u2019, they can be seen only as inferior to the open-minded multiculturalist.

The only physical signs of David being in pain were all forms of involuntary spasm: his shoulders would shrug, eyebrows lower and rise in quick succession, or his elbows flap out, making him look like a chicken. David\u2019s neurologist, however, was deeply sceptical. He could see that David no longer felt pain as he had before, but whatever David was now feeling when he saw \u2018too much yellow\u2019, it couldn\u2019t be pain.

Source: \u2018Mad Pain and Martian Pain\u2019 by David Lewis, in Readings in Philosophy of Psychology, vol. 1, edited by Ned Block (Harvard University Press, 1980) Philosophers of mind are keen on pain. They are fascinated by the nature of subjective experience and its relation to objective knowledge, and nothing seems to be more subjective and at the same time as real as pain. Just ask anyone who has suffered extreme toothache. At the same time, we are usually pretty good at spotting if someone is in pain. Unlike other mental events, such as thinking about penguins, pain affects our outer demeanour as well as our inner experience. So if you want to understand what it means to have a subjective experience, pain makes for a good case study. The story of David\u2019s \u2018mad pain\u2019 is an attempt to play with the",

The story of David\u2019s \u2018mad pain\u2019 is an attempt to play with the variables associated with pain to see which are essential and which are incidental. The three main variables are private, subjective experiences; typical causes; and behavioural responses. Mad pain has only subjective experience in common with ordinary pain; its causes and effects are quite different. If it is nonetheless accurate to describe mad pain as pain, then we should conclude that it is the subjective feeling of being in pain which is the essence of pain. Its causes and effects are merely incidental, and could be different from what they usually are. Common sense is not univocal on this.

Only philosophers and psychologists would seriously suggest that it might be better defined in terms of stimulus -response or brain function. But on the other hand, common sense would also say that a subjective experience of pain which someone didn\u2019t mind having and which caused no agitation would not be pain at all. That means the story of David is incoherent: despite what he says, he just couldn\u2019t be feeling pain at all. His neurologist is right to besceptical. And after all, we only have David\u2019s word to go on. Why should we trust his ability to recognise his inner sensations as being the same as those he had when he hurt himself before the accident? The nub of the issue, however, concerns the relation between the inner and the outer.

It might seem easy to say that pain is defined by how it feels to the sufferer, and that this has an essential link to behaviours such as avoidance and grimacing. But this solution is too quick. For if pain really is a feeling, then why should it be inconceivable to experience pain without any of the associated behaviour? It\u2019s no good just saying it must manifest itself in some way; you need to say why it must do so. Until you can, mad pain remains a possibility. See also 23. The beetle in the box 26.

Everything tha t happens exists for ever. That meant his impending death would not be the end. His life, once lived, would always exist. And so, in a sense, the life he had lived would be lived again and again, eternally recurring, each time exactly the same and thus with no hope of learning, of changing, of righting past wrongs. Had Kurtz made a success of his life he could have borne that realisation. He could have looked upon his work, thought \u2018it is good\u2019 and gone to his grave serene in his triumph over death.

I am not aware of any textual evidence that this is how we should understand Kurtz\u2019s enigmatic last words.

Nonetheless, the hypothesis of eternal recurrence and how we would react to it is an interesting device for examining ourselves.

In that film, Bill Murray found himself in the same day again and again, but each time he had the opportunity to do things differently. Hence he had the possibility of redemption, of escaping the cycle , by finally learning how to love.

I wouldn\u2019t change a thing.\u2019 On the face of it, that directly contradicts Nietzsche\u2019s claim about the intolerability of eternal recurrence. Perhaps it is not Nietzsche who is wrong, however, but those who blithely embrace their past mistakes. For when we truly try to imagine the bad experiences of our pasts, the terrible mistakes we made, the hurtful things we did, the indignities we suffered, isn\u2019t it unbearably painful?

The overman accepts the idea of recurrence without the blinkers and filters that protect us from the pain of remembering. That is why Nietzsche believed the overman was so rare, and why the rest of us would react like Kurtz to the thought of history repeating itself again, and again, and again. See also 20.

He had been told that an inspector would be making a surprise call sometime before the end of the month. Emilio had sat down and wondered what day the inspection could be.

If by the 31st only one possible day remained and the inspection would not be a complete surprise, so be it.

It is always worth reminding ourselves that the ambiguities and grey areas of language are sometimes needed for us to make sense of the world, even though these same imprecisions can on other occasions get in the way of understanding. Nevertheless, it is true that this answer leaves the hard problem unsolved. What if the promise of a surprise visit was meant quite literally, so that any resulting visit which was not a surprise, such as one that occurred on the 31st, would contradict the promise of a surprise visit?

Therefore the announcement in advance of surprise inspection cannot be made without it implying some kind of contradiction. The solution looks neat, but it is undermined by the fact that there obviously can be a surprise inspection, as Emilio foun d out, to his great cost. If the promise was made and was fulfilled, it seems hard to argue that it was incoherent. There is also the intriguing possibility that the person who reasons there can be no surprise merely shifts the source of the surprise. On the 29th, for example, Emilio would have concluded that no surprise inspection could be made on the 30th or the 31st. But that still means an inspection, albeit not a surprise one, could be made on either of the two days remaining.

Or to put it the other way round, if it is morally justifiable to let the patient die, surely it would have been equally justifiable to have turned off the machine. Yet the laws on eu thanasia do distinguish sharply between killing and letting die. This has the bizarre consequence that doctors can stop feeding a patient in a permanent vegetative state, effectively starving them to death, but they can\u2019t administer a lethal injection and kill them quickly.

There are some ethical grey areas, such as this life-support machine case, but society needs rules and the be st and clearest place to draw the line is on the boundary between killing and letting die. In a few hard cases this may mean we have unsatisfactory results, such as with the patient of Dr Grey. However, this is better than opening the door to deliberate ki lling by doctors.

If this line of reasoning is right, then not only should Percy fly free, but we should think again about how we conceive of ourselves and other animals. First, the idea that our moral significance lies in our nature as persons rather than as human beings fits well with the idea that our identity is determined not by our physical bodies but by those features of the self that are essential to being a person: thought, feeling and awareness.

In fact, there were even countries where people spoke dialects of English. Twin Earth contained cats, frying pans, burritos, televisions, baseball, beer and \u2013 at least it had seemed \u2013 water. It certainly had a clear liquid which fell from the sky, filled river s and oceans, and quenched the thirsts of the indigenous humanoids and the astronauts from Earth.

It matters if you are interested in where meaning comes from. Most of us do not have an explicit theory of meaning, but we nonetheless do assume a rough -and-ready one. This is that the meanings of words are like definitions which we carry around in our heads. For instance, let\u2019s say I mistakenly believe that a migraine is just a bad headache. I might then say, \u2018I\u2019ve got a terrible migraine.\u2019 If it is pointed out to me that I do not in fact have a migraine at all, I can admit my mistake, but I would still have a sense that I knew what I meant when I said I did.

        "I had internalised. What fixes the meaning of a word, on this account, is its definition, and definiti ons are the kinds of things that can be stored in minds as well as dictionaries. The H2No story, however, challenges this account. It should be clear that when earthlings and twin earthlings think \u2018This is water\u2019 they are having thoughts about two different substances. Earth water and Twin Earth water are not the same thing \u2013 they just happen to share the same name. Now, imagine Earth and Twin Earth 1,000 years ago. No one then knew what the chemical composition of water was. Thus, if you consider what would have gone on in the mind of someone thinking \u2018that is a glass of water\u2019, it would have been the same in the case of both the earthling and the twin earthling.

If this line of reasoning is correct \u2013 and it does seem compelling \u2013 we are left with a surprising upshot. Since what is going on in the head of the earthling and twin earthling is exactly the same, but their thoughts are different, that means thoughts are not entirely in the head!

But how fair is it to judge someone by how they would act when con fronted by more temptation than most people could resist? If we are honest, imagining ourselves with the ring may reveal that we are disappointingly corruptible, but that is not the same as saying we are actually corrupt. Perhaps what the mythical ring enables us to do is have sympathy with the devil, or at least some of his minor cohorts. Celebrities behaving badly, for example, attract our disapproval. But how can we imagine what it is like to have enormous wealth, endless opportunities for indulgence and sycophantic hangers -on ready to pander to our every whim?

If you ask people how they think others would behave with the ring and how they themselves would, you will often find a stark contrast.

Usha is a cheat. There\u2019s no doubt about that. She is pretending that she has read and remembered things that in fact her amazing implant is bringing to her mind for the first time.

Usha used to be intellectually intimidated because she was surrounded by people who were able to cite, quote and reference great works with ease. Do such people really display any great intelligence or merely an ability to recall? Note that Timothy may have started the conversation by evoking a Keats poem, but its eponymous heroine didn\u2019t actually look like Usha at all.

In her own mind the answer was clear: to protect the public and to make sure justice was done. Those considerations were more important than following the rules. She kept telling herself that, because she feared she lacked the resolve to break the rules in order to stay true to her ideals. A good man had made a terrible mistake, and an innocent woman was dead as a result. But by a sequence of accidents and coincidences, Marsha had enough circumstantial and forensic evidence to convict a different man of the crime.

Only in exceptional circumstances should we bend or break the rules. It is in the best interests of all of us that we forbid people from taking the law into their own hands, even if they do so for good motives.

Second, the action should not undermine rule-following in general. This condition would also be met, as long as Ma rsha\u2019s deceit remained secret. Third, the rulebreaking must be the only means of achieving the better outcome. It seems there is no other way in which Marsha could ensure the real menace ends up in prison.

People like Tryne are described as \u2018good\u2019, \u2018kind\u2019 or \u2018generous\u2019 more often than people like Schuyler. We sense that their kindness is deeply rooted in their personalities and flows naturally from them. The instinctiveness of their generosity suggests that the very essence of their being is good.

        "s of their generosity suggests that the very essence of their being is good. In contrast, much as we can admire people like Schuyler, we do not sense their goodness in the same way. At best, we may learn to admire their willingness to submit to what they see as their duties. It is interesting that we should respond in that way. For if morality is about doing the right thing, it is far from obvious that we should think Tryne is more morally praiseworthy than Schuyler. Indeed, as ha s been suggested, in her guileless way Tryne is perhaps more likely to do the wrong thing than Schuyler. For example, when travelling in Africa, you will frequently be asked by children for pencils, or sometimes money. Tryne would surely give. But Schuyler would probably think a little more, and conclude, along with most development agencies, that this kind of giving encourages dependence as well as feelings of inferiority and helplessness.

        "lude, along with most development agencies, that this kind of giving encourages dependence as well as feelings of inferiority and helplessness. It is far better to give directly to a school, and preserve the dignity of those you want to help. There is a second reason to temper one\u2019s praise of Tryne. Since her actions are unthinking, isn\u2019t it just a matter of luck that she tends to act well? Why should we praise someone for just happening to have a generally go od set of dispositions? What is worse, unless we reflect on our feelings, might not our instincts lead us astray? Think, for instance, about the many people in history who have shared Tryne\u2019s basic personality, but who have been brought up in racist cultures. Such people were often as unthinking in their racism as they were in their kindness. Maybe we could go further. Schuyler deserves more moral credit precisely because she acts well in spite of her lack of instinctive empathy and compassion. Whereas Tryn e\u2019s",

Whereas Tryn e\u2019s kindness requires no particular effort, Schuyler\u2019s is a triumph of human will over natural inclination. However, reversing our instinctive judgement and seeing Schuyler as the more morally praiseworthy creates different problems. After all, doesn\u2019t it seem odd to say that the person whose goodness is more intimately enmeshed in their personality is less virtuous than the one who does good only because they reason that they should? The trite solution to the dilemma is simply to say that goodness requires a marriage of head and heart, and that, while both Tryne and Schuyler manifest some facets of virtue, neither provides the model of the well -rounded, ethical individual.

Hence the curious question, \u2018When a film is shown on Earth, does it make a smell?\u2019 For, bizarre though it may sound, this question is just as pertinent as the classic one about the forest. The puzzles arise fr om the realisation that how we perceive the world depends as much, if not more, on our constitutions as the world itself. It just so happens that airwaves of a certain frequency are translated by our brains into sounds. Dogs hear things that we do not, and there is no logical reason why other creatures couldn\u2019t translate these same waves into smells, tactility or colours.

        "esthesia \u2013 sensory crossover, in which colours are heard or sounds seen \u2013 occurs in humans either permanently as a rare con dition or temporarily, induced by hallucinogenic drugs such as LSD. Given these plain facts, the question arises as to whether such things as sounds exist in the absence of creatures who hear. It is certainly the case that the air vibrates when a tree falls in an empty forest. But if sounds are in the ears of the hearers, isn\u2019t it the case that with no ears there are no sounds? If you want to resist this conclusion and say that when a tree falls on Galafray it does make a sound, surely you also have to say that, by the same logic, when a film is shown on Earth, it does make a smell. For to say the tree makes a sound does not mean that anyone hears anything. It can only mean that events occur such that, if a person were present, they would hear a sound.

All it means is that, if a person who smelled what we saw were present, they would smell the film. That seems to be as true as the claim that, if a human were in the Galafrayan forest when the tree fell, they would hear something. This line of reasoning would seem to lead to the absurd conclusion that the world is filled with noises no one hears, colours no one sees, flavours no one tastes, textures no one feels, as well as a host of other sense experiences we cannot even imagine.

Having been used only to dial-up, she loved the fact that n ow her internet connection was always on, and also that surfing and downloading was so much quicker. And it was a bonus that it happened to be completely free. Well, to say it was free was perhaps a little misleading. Eleanor paid nothing for the service because she was using her neighbour\u2019s WiFi connection, otherwise known as a wireless Local Area Network. This enabled any computer within a limited range, as long as it had the right software and hardware, to connect without cables to a broadband internet c onnection.

In fact, a neat pi ece of software called Good Magpie made sure that her use of the connection never slowed her neighbour down by more than a negligible amount. So she got the benefits of his connection, but he didn\u2019t suffer as a result. What could be wrong with that? Lots of people with WiFi capabilities on their laptops or handheld devices \u2018borrow\u2019 bandwidth on an occasional, ad hoc basis.

Looked at in that light, Eleanor is no more a thief th an someone who uses the shade cast by a tree in a neighbour\u2019s garden. This is a particular example of the freeloader problem.

A community organises a free concert in the park, which someone comes across by chance and enjoys at the very edge of the crowd, depriving nobody of their pleasure. But she makes no donation to the costs when the bucket comes round. Someone e lse illegally downloads from the internet a song which they would never buy. The artist is not deprived of any income since, had she been forcedto pay, the downloader wouldn\u2019t have bothered. But she nevertheless enjoys the song.

Similarly, it might be fine to pay nothing for a free concert you stumble across, if you make voluntary contributions to others you set out to visit.

She has the chance to run off with the husband of her best friend, taking their entire family fortune with them. On the face of it, that would not be doing as s he would be done by. But, she reasoned, things are more complex than that. When we lock up a criminal, we are not saying we should also be locked up. We are saying that we should be locked up if we were in the same circumstances as the criminal. That proviso is crucial: context is all. So, the question she should be asking herself is this: can she \u2018will that it should become a universal law\u2019 that people in her circumstances should run off with their best friend\u2019s husband and fortune? Put like that, the answ er seems to be yes. She\u2019s not saying adultery and asset -stripping are usually good, only that in her specific circumstances they are.

Sources: The Analects of Confucius (5th century BCE); Gr oundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals by Immanuel Kant (1785) The golden rule of Confucius has emerged in various forms in virtually all the major ethical systems humankind has devised. In its simplicity it seems to offer a moral rule of thumb that we can all follow. The problem Constance\u2019s situation highlights is not just a sophistical joke at the rule\u2019s expense. It goes to the heart of what the principle actually means. For either one of two extreme interpretations, the principle is either ridiculous or empty. If it means that we should never do to anyone else what we would not have done to ourselves, no matter what the circumstance, then we would never do anything unpleasant, such as punish or restrain.

Since we would object to being locked up oursel ves, we would not lock up serial murderers. That is a nonsense. That is why Constance is right to see that circumstances have to come into it. But because every circumstance is slightly different, every case is in some sense unique. So anything we did coul d be justified on the grounds that we would agree to be treated in the same way in exactly the same circumstance. But then the universal aspect of the golden rule vanishes and the rule becomes empty. So, should we look for the middle path? This would have to involve some idea of relevant similarity. We should do as we would be done by in any situation which, though not exactly the same, is similar in the morally relevant ways. So, for example, although all unlawful killings are different, they a",

So, for example, although all unlawful killings are different, they are all relevantly similar in respect to the key moral issues. Something like this approach has to be taken for the golden rule to work, but what we now have is far from a simple, transparent rule at all. For identifying relevant similarities is not an easy task, and i t is not just those looking for excuses for wrongdoing who might claim a crucial relevant difference. Human affairs are extremely complex and if we fail to attend to the particularities of each case, we risk failing to do justice to them. And so we come ba ck to Constance.

A life full only of lower pleasures was worse than one with even just a few higher ones. This still leaves the problem of justification: why is it better? Mill proposed a test. We should ask what competent judges would decide. Those who had tasted both higher and lower pleasures were the best placed to determine which were superior.

Making the distinction between the quality of the work and the point of its existence is crucial to seeing Marion\u2019s dilemma, for there is l ittle doubt that the statue in the box is an artwork of some quality. What is at issue is whether there is any point in such an artwork existing if no one can see it. The preservers will say that the world is a better place by virtue simply of the statue existing. Those calling for demolition will counter that this is absurd: the world is improved because of the effects artworks have on those who view them. If people cannot feed on art, it serves no purpose.

This is because there seems to be something wilfully perverse about achieving equality by levelling down. We could easily make everyone equal simply by making everyone as poor as the poorest person in society. But that seems obviously to be a foolish thing to do because it doesn\u2019t help anyone. The poorest remain just as poor as they were and everyone else is harmed.

John\u2019s explanation to Margaret about why they should treat their sons differently provides one answer. Inequality is permitted when no one is worse off as a result, but some people are better off. This is very similar to what the political philosopher John Rawls called the \u2018difference principle\u2019. In essence, this says that inequalities are permitted only if they are to the benefit of the least well off. However, it is not clear whether this applies to Matthew, Mark and Luke. Under the original gift plan, they form a classless micro-society in which each is the best and worst off. The pl an to get the PlayBoyPlusMax deal does indeed make two of the least well off better off, but it is no help at all to the other one.

Of course, there are important differ ences when the principle is applied in the political and familial arenas. In society at large, John\u2019s argument seems intuitively persuasive. Within families, however, there may be reasons to place a higher priority on equality, since in very small groups, inequalities are felt more keenly and can lead to tensions. This same consideration, however, does extend to the political domain. For one reason to be against inequality is precisely the effect it has on social cohesion and the self -esteem of the poor.

He was given a choice: spend the rest of his life in maximum security prison, where they would make su re he was victimised by the other inmates; or have his memory erased and replaced with that of an entirely fictitious creation of the spooks at the SBI. He chose the latter. And so it was that Alan E. Wood was put under a general anaesthetic, and when he woke up, he had forgotten all about his life to date. Instead, he remembered an entirely fictitious past, that of Arnold Conan, the man he now believed he was. Conan had established that these were the facts.

It seems he is either someone deeply unpleasant he knows nothing about or the fictitious creation of the security agencies. He is unlikely to want either possibility to be the truth. Many people\u2019s initial intuition is that Conan is really Alan E. Wood. This is understandable. Our identity usually follows that of our brains and bodies. Since the life of the organism named Alan E. Wood at birth has continued uninterrupted, and there is no other person with a claim to his name walking the Earth, it would seem that Conan is Wood.

Whatever he remembers of his childhood, for example, never really happened. Conan seems as unreal as Wood does real. So can there be any doubt that Conan is Wood, albeit mentally altered beyond all recognition? In Conan\/Wood\u2019s mind, certainly. For whatever the logic of our reasoning dictates, he feels like Conan, not Wood. He would not, for example, experience any desire to have his old self restored. Indeed, he might be horrified by the idea that he would once again become the amoral man he once was. Before we say that he is simply in denial about the truth, consider that he has lived as Conan for two years; not all his past is fictitious. Consider also how people can suffer widespread amnesia.

If you received a bump on the head and lost all memories of your past up un til two years ago, you would certainly be changed by the experience, but you would not be transformed into someone else entirely. So it is not hard to see how Conan\/Wood could be seen as being Wood. It is just that Conan has existed only for a few years, a nd all his memories of before that time are false. The fact that he started out as an artificial creation does not negate the fact that he has lived for two years as a real human being. If the case can be made both ways, how are we to decide which is most persuasive? If we ask different questions, we will get different answers.

For others, if Greg pulls the lever he is placing himself in the position of God, deciding who is to live and who is to die. Certainly, we should try to save lives, but not if we can do so only by killing others. If we justify killing by the other lives it saves, we are on a slippery slope. The problem with this second line of reasoning is that it seems Greg is choosing who will die whether he pulls the lever or not. He is not electing to take on God\u2019s role, he has had it thrust upon him. The important point is not whether he acts or does not act, but that it is within his power to act or not act and that either way he must take responsibility for his choice.

And isn\u2019t it misguided to say that Greg would be responsible for the deaths of the workers on the line if he pulled the lever but without any responsibility at all if he doesn\u2019t?

As we develop a basic scientific understanding of the world, we probably come to see this difference in terms of the underlying atomic structure of objects and the way in which they appear to us. We may be dimly aware that this atomic structure itself is explained in terms of sub -atomic structure, but we need not bother ourselves with the details of our current best science.

If you played them soothing music they would appear to enjoy it, but in their minds they would hear nothing. On the outside, they were ordinary humans, but on the inside, nothing was going on. This made them easy to get along with. It was easy to forget that they didn\u2019t have inner lives as she did, since they spoke and behaved just like ordinary people and that included references to how they felt or what they thought.

Even when Lucia let them in on the secret, they refused to believe her. \u2018How do you know that they have no minds?\u2019 they would ask. \u2018How do you know that other people do?\u2019 would b e Lucia\u2019s reply. That usually shut them up. \u2018How do you know?\u2019 is often a very good question. It is also, alas, one it is very hard to answer conclusively. We rarely, perhaps never, know beyond any doubt whatsoever. The best we can hope for is to have good reasons for what we believe. Better reasons, at least, than those for believing the contrary. That is why we don\u2019t feel we need to worry about the possibility that we are living among zombies. Even if it is possible that we are, as long as we have more reasons to believe that we aren\u2019t, we can safely avoid fretting over improbable possibilities.

The reasons for thinking other people aren\u2019t zombies are principally ones of economy. If they walk like us, talk like us and have brains and bodies like us, the n the chances are they are like us in all significant respects, including how things feel to them from the inside. It would be very odd if the nervous system which gives me consciousness didn\u2019t do the same for others. This, however, is precisely the point at which the zombie possibility becomes interesting. For why should we think that physical similarities are indicative of mental ones? The problem of consciousness is precisely that it seems inexplicable that purely physical entities such as brains should give rise to subjective experiences. Why should a C -fibre firing in the brain feel like anything at all? What has that brain event got to do with the sensation of pain? If these questio",
        "ains should give rise to subjective experiences. Why should a C -fibre firing in the brain feel like anything at all? What has that brain event got to do with the sensation of pain? If these questions seem serious and without satisfactory answers, then it would follow from them that there is nothing logically contradictory in imagining brain events such as C-fibres firing without any concomitant sensation. In other words, the idea of zombies \u2013 people just like us in every physical respect, but who have no inner lives at all \u2013 is perfectly coherent. And so the possibility that other people are such zombies, however improbable, is a real one. As in horror films, killing off the zombies is no easy task. In order to discount the possibility of their existence, you need to sh ow why it is that a creature that has the same physiology as us mustalso have the same basic psychology.

That means, for example, showing why C-fibre firing must feel like pain, rather than seeing the colour yellow, or nothing at all. It\u2019s a challenge that so far no one has been able to meet to the general satisfaction of philosophers. Until someone does, we cannot be sure that zombies do not walk the Earth. See also 19.

These are taxing times for our country. The last government left us with run-down public finances and the need to raise extra revenue. But you, the people, do not want to have to foot the bill.

Focus groups, opinion polls and economists have shown that charging an extra 0.01 per cent tax has a negligible effect on perso nal income. No one who is comfortably off is made to struggle, no one rich is made poor, no one already struggling is made to struggle more, by paying 0.01 per cent extra on their tax bill. So today we are raising income tax by 0.01 per cent. And logically, since this small amount makes as little difference to the person who earns 0.01 per cent less than you as it does to you, we can repeat the step tomorrow, when you are in the position of that insignificantly poorer person. And so the next day, and the next, for the next 300 days. Each time we raise taxes, we do so in a way that makes no difference to your quality of life.

Yet, miraculously, the net effect of these measures will be a large increase in gover nment revenue, which we intend to use to cut the national debt and still have enough change left to buy everyone in the country a drink. We hope you will use it to toast our ingenuity. Source: The ancient Sorites paradox, attributed to Eubulides of Miletus (4th century BCE) A politician who made a speech like this should not expect to win any votes by so doing. Even if your maths isn\u2019t up to calculating that he is actually proposing a tax rise in excess of 3 per cent, no one would be fooled that 300 tiny t ax rises don\u2019t add up to a major hike. Yet the logic of the Chancellor is hard to fault. It follows that of the ancient Sorites paradox.

        "he Chancellor is hard to fault. It follows that of the ancient Sorites paradox. In the original, we are asked if removing a grain of sand from a heap can ever transform the heap into a non-heap (a small pile, perhaps). The answer seems to be no. But that means you could keep removing a grain of sand, one by one, until you had only one left, and that would still be a heap. One solution appears to be that somewhere along the line, removing a grain of sand does mean that we no longer have a heap. But that just seems absurd. Hence the paradox: if one grain makes a difference, that is absurd; if it doesn\u2019t, a single grain can be a heap, which is just as absurd. Our tax example suggests a way out. Could we n ot argue that each small increment does make a difference, although it is just a small difference? Clearly, if you add up several small differences you can end up with a big one. This does not, however, get to the heart of the problem. The paradox is that no tiny change in i",

The paradox is that no tiny change in income can be enough to make the difference between someone being well -off or struggling. The paradox is precisely the contrast between what is obvious when we \u2018zoom out\u2019 and see the cumulative effect of small changes and when we \u2018zoom in\u2019 and see each one having no effect at all. When confronted by this paradox, most people are convinced it\u2019s just a linguistic trick or there is some other sleight of hand at work. The puzzle should be taken more seriously, however. Many argue that the way out requires us to accept the vagueness of many concepts, such as rich and poor, tall or short, heap or pile. The problem with that solution is that, if we allow too much vagueness into language and logic, reason itself becomes vague. The alternative \u2013 that tiny changes really can make",

Yet you don\u2019t stop it. Is it that you can\u2019t? In which case, you are not all -powerful. Is it because you don\u2019t know about it? In which case you are not all-knowing.

For that you need the freedom to do evil as well as good, and to confront the chance occurrence of suffering. How could I po ssibly have made the world better without taking away your freedom to grow?\u2019 \u2018Easy,\u2019 replied the philosopher. \u2018First, you could have designed us so that we felt less pain. Second, you could have made sure we had more empathy, to prevent us doing evil to ot hers. Third, you could have made us better learners, so we didn\u2019t have to suffer so much to grow.

Do you want me to go on?\u2019 Source: The problem of evil recurs in different forms throughout the history of theology Could God have made a world in which there was less suffering but in which we had the same opportunities to exercise our free will and, as the religious put it, grow spiritually? It is difficult to answer this question without simply pandering to our prior prejudices. For atheists, the answer is obviously yes. The philosopher in our story makes four suggestions straight away. None of these seems impossible. Consider that a certain amount of empathy comes naturally to us, and that makes most of us less willing to harm others. If thatis compatible with us having free will, why would having more empathy threaten it? Consider also that our ability to learn is also something we have no direct control over. Indeed, some of us are better at it than others. Why couldn\u2019t God have made us all better learn"
